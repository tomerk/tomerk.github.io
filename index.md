title: About
---
I am a Computer Science PhD student at the University of Washington, working with [Magdalena Balazinska](https://www.cs.washington.edu/people/faculty/magda) and [Alvin Cheung](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~akcheung/). My research interests include machine learning systems, distributed systems, and query optimization.

Previously, I was a staff engineer in [UC Berkeley's AMPLab](https://amplab.cs.berkeley.edu). I supported research projects in the AMPLab such as [KeystoneML](http://keystone-ml.org) and [Velox](https://github.com/amplab/velox-modelserver).

Before working in the AMPLab, I spent several years building information retrieval systems at [Quixey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quixey). I received my Bachelor's degree in [EECS](https://www.eecs.berkeley.edu) from UC Berkeley in December 2013.

In the past, I dabbled in updating popular video games with better [graphics shaders](https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivion/mods/37825/?).

In my spare time I like to travel, cook, hike, and read literature.
