title: About
---

I am a staff engineer in [UC Berkeley's AMPLab](https://amplab.cs.berkeley.edu), as of October 2014. My role is to support research projects in the AMPLab such as [KeystoneML](http://keystone-ml.org) and [Velox](https://github.com/amplab/velox-modelserver). My research interests lie in the spaces of distributed systems and data analytics.

Before working in the AMPLab, I spent several years building information retrieval systems at [Quixey](http://www.quixey.com). I received my Bachelor's degree in  [EECS](https://www.eecs.berkeley.edu) from UC Berkeley in December 2013.

In my spare time I like to travel, cook, hike, and read literature.
